Quick installation guide
------------------------

* Unzip and copy the whole manopt directory in a location of your choice on disk, say, in /my/directory/.
* Add /my/directory/manopt/ to the Matlab path, either by typing addpath('/my/directory/manopt/') at the command prompt, or through the menu File >> Set Path... >> Add Folder....
* Save the path if you would like Matlab to remember this.

* Go to /my/directory/manopt/checkinstall/ and run the script basicexample.m. If there are no errors, you are done!
