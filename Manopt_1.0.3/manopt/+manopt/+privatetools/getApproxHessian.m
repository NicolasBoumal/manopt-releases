% Computes an approximation of the Hessian of the cost fun. at x along d.

% function [approxhess, storedb] = getApproxHessian(problem, x, d, storedb)
%
% Returns an approximation of the Hessian at x along d of the cost function
% described in the problem structure. The cache database storedb is passed
% along, possibly modified and returned in the process.
%
% If no approximate Hessian was furnished, this call is redirected to
% getHessianFD.
